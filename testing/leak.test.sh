# THE LEAK GATE — what a bot carries, and what stays in the factory.
#
# A bot built from this baseline is somebody's bot, not a copy of this
# repository. It gets the product: the Worker, the upstream libraries it
# bundles (with upstream's licence), its KV root, its tests, its CI, its
# tooling, its README and its two context pages. It does
# NOT get the factory: the blueprints, the bootstrap and rebrand tooling, the
# test gates, the task contracts and identity under `.baseline/`, this
# repository's own epic and task tree, or BOOTSTRAP.md — and no file it does
# get may so much as NAME one of those paths, because in the product they do
# not exist.
#
# This asks orun to DERIVE the placement — every file every phase would write
# — and gates that set and the sources it is copied from. Derivation runs no
# hooks, contacts nothing and writes nothing. testing/placement.test.sh gates
# the same rules over a tree that is actually placed and branded.
#
# Needs: orun + python3. No network, no credential.
